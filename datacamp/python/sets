Sets
- can only contain unique elements
- items do not maintain a specific order (unordered)
- mutable
- implementation of mathematics set theory
- almost always created from a list
- can create a set by using set()
-.add() used to add a single elements
 -- only adds new item if it is not in the set
- .update() merges in another set or list
 -- only adds new item if it is not in the set
- .discard() 
 -- used to safely removes an element from the set by value
- .pop()
 -- removes and returns an element from the set
 -- keyError when empty
- set operations
 -- ..union()
  -- returns a set of all the names
  -- similar to 'or'
 -- .intersection()
  -- identifies overlapping data
  -- similar to 'and'
 -- .difference()
  -- identifies the differences in the two sets and returns what the first set does not have
  -- the order in which this is done effects the output
